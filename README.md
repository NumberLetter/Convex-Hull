# CSC 212 Convex Hull Final Project

This project is the compilation of all things related to my group's work on our final project for our CSC 212 class. The class focused on data structures and abstrations.

# Convex-Hull
In order to better understand our project itself, its important to understand the mathematical concept behind our project, the **Convex Hull**.

Convex Hulls have many real life applications:
  - Collision avoidance
      - In video games
      - roomba/robotics
  - Tracking Disease Epidemic
  - Nuclear/Chemical Leak Evacuation
  - Basketball



# Graham Scan

Our task was to code the [Graham Scan Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Graham_scan&oldid=981736794) and create a visualization of the processed data.

# Quickhull
We chose to go a step further and do an additional algorithm for comparison with the Graham Scan Algorithm. The additional algorithm implemented was the [Quickhull Algorith](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Quickhull&oldid=986184164).
